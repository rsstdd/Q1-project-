# The "Balanced" News Project

This project was inspired by morning standup meetings. During our morning discussions of current events, most of the news seemed unpleasant or dark in nature. While I recognize that it is important to be apprised of these events, I also like to expose myself to uplifting articles lest I forget about the inherent goodness of man.

The primary objective of this project, however, was to learn how to utilize external APIs and familiarize myself with jQuery and the Materialize CSS framework. To accomplish this task, I used NewsAPI to create an aggregate of the top-ten stories for several major media companies. I also used Reddit API to grab items from the r/uplifting subreddit to ensure that I would have a number of positive articles.
